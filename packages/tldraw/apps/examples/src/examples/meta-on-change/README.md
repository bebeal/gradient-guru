title: Shape Meta (on change)
component: ./OnChangeShapeMetaExample.tsx
---

Add custom metadata to shapes when they're changed.

---

We can update a shape's metadata whenever it changes. A UI displays the current selected shape's metadata. Create a shape, select it, and move it around. The metadata will updated any time the shape changes.
