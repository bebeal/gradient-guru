title: Shape Meta (on create)
component: ./OnCreateShapeMetaExample.tsx
---

Add custom metadata to shapes when they're created.

---

We can update a shape's metadata whenever it is created. A UI displays the current selected shape's metadata. Create a shape and select it. The metadata will display its created at / created by data.
